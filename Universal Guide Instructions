# Global Assumptions (updated)

(You don’t have to paste this every time, but this is the underlying contract Cursor should honor.)

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + React + TypeScript

Backend: Next.js API Routes (monolith)

DB: PostgreSQL via Prisma

Auth: NextAuth (Auth.js) with credentials provider

Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables (tenant theming)

State: React Query / TanStack Query

PWA: Installable, basic offline support

AI: OpenAI (or compatible) via OPENAI_API_KEY


All third-party integrations are tenant-level via OAuth (NOT per-user):

One Google OAuth connection per tenant, reused for:

Google Calendar API (scheduling)

Gmail API (sending/reading mail from a shared studio account like design@brand.com)


One Stripe OAuth connection per tenant (Stripe Connect Standard or direct OAuth)

One QuickBooks Online OAuth connection per tenant

Cursor must never assume user-level tokens for these services.


You provide only:

DATABASE_URL (and create the DB)

OAuth client IDs/secrets and configure redirect URIs

Stripe/Google/QBO/Gmail credentials in .env ....then let me know when you are ready for phase 0 of the build instructions
